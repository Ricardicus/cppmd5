/*  The following tests optimise behaviour on little-endian
    machines, where there is no need to reverse the byte order
    of 32 bit words in the MD5 computation.  By default,
    HIGHFIRST is defined, which indicates we're running on a
    big-endian (most significant byte first) machine, on which
    the byteReverse function in md5.c must be invoked. However,
    byteReverse is coded in such a way that it is an identity
    function when run on a little-endian machine, so calling it
    on such a platform causes no harm apart from wasting time. 
    If the platform is known to be little-endian, we speed
    things up by undefining HIGHFIRST, which defines
    byteReverse as a null macro.  Doing things in this manner
    insures we work on new platforms regardless of their byte
    order.  */
